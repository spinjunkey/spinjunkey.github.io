Last              October I turned 51 and have been working since I was 15 –              starting off where              most teenagers do, Baskin and Robbins serving ice cream. Let’s              just say it              takes a long time for some people to figure out what they are not              only good at,              but what they want to do with their life. </p>            <p>I grew up on the east coast, but never felt like I fit in to              the rush-n-go culture. As a young kid, I became conscious about              the delicate              balance in our world that all life exists. Seeing all the trash on              the sides of              roads, in forests, and streams made me sad. I couldn’t understand              how people              could just discard their garbage like it didn’t matter. I wanted              them to see              the impacts of that wrapper they just threw on the ground.              Especially how it              impacts quality of life including ours. I didn’t know it then, but              I was on the              path to lead change for good. </p>            <p>At the same time, my creative temperament would sometimes              direct me to activities that most of the popular kids turned their              noses up at.              Art, LEGO, and at the time, computers. It was the beginning of the              computer age              – my first computer being one my dad brought home from GE where he              worked. A              suitcase with all kinds of electronic components. The crown jewel              was the 8              segment LEDs that lit up.</p>            <div class="testimonial-wrap">              <div class="testimonial"> <q style="font-size: 1.6em; font-weight: 300; font-style: oblique;">Adults                  need play too. It's how we learn, solve problems, etc.</q> </div>            </div>            <p>1984 provided me with a big interruption on my path. A move 3000              miles west to Portland Oregon changed everything. Talk about              culture shock. The              change was really hard at first. But, over time I found my groove              and realized              that west coast culture “fit” me. Chill and relaxed, low key. I              also began to              see the amount of people that cared as much as I did about our              planet.</p>            <p>High school provided ample opportunities to dive into my              creativity.</p>            <p>This innate interest led me to continue my path of empathy              for our <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">house</i> by              studying Environmental              Science in college. At the same time, I found myself immersed in              all thing’s              media and art. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>I got              involved with KBVR,              the local college radio station. I discovered a love for              storytelling and              creative problem solving. I learned how I could use creative media              as tools to tell              stories. I was so excited, I started doing TV weather for the              local student run              news channel.</p>            <p>For the first time a light bulb moment went on for me – I              realized              how I could be passionate about the environment and help others              through              creatively addressing problems and communications.</p>            <p>After graduation in 1993, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">m</span>y focus shifted from my passion for storytelling to my career,              and eventually marriage and kids. Like so many people, my dreams              took a              backseat. </p>            <p>My first gig out of school wasn’t working in journalism or on              environmental issues. Instead, I got a job with a computer              peripheral              manufacturer. The tech industry was booming. I cut my teeth doing              Tech Support.              The job required me to “translate” technical concepts to people              who didn’t have              a background with technology. I had to be super creative in the              way I              communicated with these tech <i>noobies</i>.</p>            <p>As the years went by, these creative skills would interlace              throughout              my career. Eventually I landed in a nascent area that became              modern day “User              Experience Design”. I was working at Nike when this industry              started growing. At              the time the work was very focused on people. </p>            <p>As the field matured, it shifted into a more data driven              approach -- establishing&nbsp;metrics as the indicators of              business success. Because              of this shift, the human-to-human translation and creativity piece              that I loved              so much vanished. It no longer aligned with my interests. </p>            <p>That change in focus led me to jump ship and move to Intel. Here              I found a role that allowed me to do more of the things I was              passionate about.              Interestingly, through some work I did inside Intel Labs, I was              connected to a              team in HR looking at the Future of Work. To my surprise, a role              opened on the              Work Practice Innovations team and was asked to join. It was here              that I began              a journey back into being a change agent. I spent time at              innovation industry              events talking about the new areas our team was exploring and              trying to push              the needle in.</p>            <div class="testimonial-wrap">              <div class="testimonial"> <q style="font-size: 1.6em; font-weight: 300; font-style: oblique;">At                  Intel, I saw my job to inspire creativity and push the limit                  of what's possible.</q> </div>            </div>            <p>As a way to do things “differently”, I produced a weekly              video to show our accomplishments to our senior leaders. Through              serendipity, I              met a small group of video producers at Intel. The connect opened              an opportunity              to become a presenter and host another weekly show on the Intel              Software              YouTube channel called “AI News”. </p>            <p>I encountered many opportunities at Intel. For the past 12              years, I have worked in many roles including as a company              “freelancer”, working              in various business groups to help improve communication and              business              understanding. Currently I am part of a team in Intel’s Data              Center Group to              help accelerate cultural change. </p>            <p>This role became essential in honing my creativity and              change leadership skills. As I started doing many different things              that were              not typical <i>corporate</i>, the word spread internally. I              became the go-to person              for designing and developing ideas – specifically and producing              short,              professional videos to explain company initiatives to employees.              The fire began              to burn bright again. I was excited to get out of bed each day.              Educating              people was a way to make change for good. Although I realized              there was still              so much to learn. I wanted to become a better storyteller to              affect change.<span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow"><o:p></o:p></span></p>            <p>Recently on vacation I had time to reflect on my personal              path. I feel that I am beginning to outgrow the company I have              worked at for so              long. With so many organizational changes, creative friends moving              on, I’m              afraid that my time on this planet is running out. I want to do              something              bigger with my life. Enter the Creativity and Change Leadership              Certificate at Buffalo              State. I see the certificate as a professional and personal              development goal.              I’m looking for a framework for leading creative change and              telling stories across              multiple platforms. </p>            <p>As I get older in age, my dream has become more focused              through my many career paths and experiences. I hope to influence              change via              creativity and communication to tell deeply human stories about              culture, the              environment, and ways for us to do good. In fact, one day I hope              to be a              motivational speaker that focuses on personal development, the              affect we have              on our environment, and telling the stories that matter. I want to              lead some              type of social change. I don’t know what this looks like yet, but              I am              confident that this program will help me reach this goal.</p>            <p>Tattooed on my arm I have a Native Hawaiian proverb I heard              in my travels there: <i>Aloha ‘Aina, Malama ‘Aina</i>. Loosely              translated It              means <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">“love the land,                respect the land.”</i>              This is something our modern culture has forgotten. I would be              honored and              grateful to be considered for this program to help people remember              we are one              people, one planet. We’re all connected. My kids are counting on              me. And their              kids.
