        <p>Talks let me combine images (slides) and text (my speech) in a more tension-building, direct way than blog posts. I've given some general data vis workshops and talks, but here I show the talks I used as an excuse to research a completely new question:

    <!-- <h2>Talk inquries</h2>
    <p>It's very likely that I'll decline an offer to speak at your event these days – I'm trying to travel less and enjoy Berlin instead. You can still try:<br><a href="mailto:lisacharlotterost@gmail.com">lisacharlotterost@gmail.com</a><br><br> -->
    <!-- I want the audience of your event to take away as much as they can from my talk. To stay sane despite that sense of perfection, please understand that I decided to only give a few but well prepared talks each year. I will decide for or against giving a talk at your event based on a combination of indicators: location, potential learnings from other talks (if any), how excited I am about other speakers at the event (if any), speaker fee or other expenses, and potential impact.
    If you could talk about these points in your first email, I'd be very grateful. Thank you!<br><br> -->
