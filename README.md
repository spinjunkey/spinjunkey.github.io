# Oh look, it's my portfolio + blog!


Built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/):

- `_posts` contains every page that's published.
- `_drafts+` contains all articles that are unpublished. Mostly articles I started writing and never finished.
- `pic` contains all images.

---

- `_data` just contains the site = menu structure
- `_includes` contains snippets; most importantly the sidebar and the head part of each page (incl. twitter settings).
- `_layouts` contains page layouts, e.g. the layout for external links.
- `_sass` contains the CSS.
- `_site` contains the rendered site; it's content should never be changed.

## History
Before July 2019, I had a single-page website with images of my projects, accessible via the address [lisacharlotterost.de](http://lisacharlotterost.de/). I built it with simple HTML & CSS a few years back. It looked like this:

On another address – [lisacharlotterost.github.io](https://lisacharlotterost.github.io/) – I hosted a blog with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It looked like this:

This wasn't a satisfying situation because of a few reasons. [Find them all in this blog post.](https://lisacharlotterost.de/newsite)

Thanks to [Jonathan Muth](https://twitter.com/jonathanmuth) for his help with building the website – especially the super-custom home-baked cookie warning couldn't have happened without him.
